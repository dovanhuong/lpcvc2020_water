# Classification accuracy and latency notebook guide

Steps:
1. For contestants, the first step is to download the Imagenet validation dataset and decompress the dataset.
    Imagenet validation dataset can be downloaded at official site: http://image-net.org/download-images.  
2. The second step is to use the gen_data.py to generate the image.list.gt file. For this you will need to download Imagenet_class_index.json 
    [Download link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/deep-learning-models/image-models/imagenet_class_index.json]
3. The third step is to integrate your programs according to the interface requirement in utils.py
4. Finally, run the classification program (test_accuracy_latency.ipynb) with the imagenet validation dataset to get the final result, including performance result and accuracy result.


Included files:

  - test_accuracy_latency.ipynb : This is the main test program for classification accuracy and latency test. 
    For most of classification test, imagenet2012 was used as the test data set. 
    
  - image.list.gt : is the ground truth of imagenet2012. User should use the gen_data.py that we provided to generate it.
        
        Steps to run gen_data.py
        
          1. Download imagenet validation dataset and decompress dataset. Move the gen_data.py and Imagenet_class_index.json files to the following location:
              "imagenet-object-localization-challenge/ILSVRC/Annotations/CLS-LOC/"
          2. In this location run Command: 
             python gen_data.py 
        
  - image.list.result : is the output result of the contestant's respective programs. Please refer to "classification_result.sample" for the format requirements of the output results.  
  
  - evaluation.py : is used for the accuracy calculation.
  
  - utils.py :is the interface definition file and the contestants must implement its functions according to the interface definition.
  
    Note that if you use the other data set for test, you have to prepare the ground truth of the data set.
  - classification_result.sample : to show the format of result. 
    If you run a image named "001.jpg", you will get the top-5 labels. you should write 5 lines to result file, every line include image name and label index.
